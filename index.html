                            **Web analytics** is the **measurement**, **collection**, **analysis**<br>and **reporting**
                            of web data for purposes of **understanding**<br>and **optimizing web usage**.

                            <br>
                            * It can be used as a tool for business and market research
                            * There are two categories of web analytics:

                              - **off-site** web analytics
                              - **on-site** web analytics

                            Off-site web analytics refers to web measurement and analysis regardless of
                            whether you own/maintain a website.

                            On-site web analytics measures a **visitor's behavior<br>once on your website**.
                            There are two main technical<br>ways of collecting the data: **server log file
                            analysis**,<br>and **page tagging**.

                            <br>

                            Web servers record some of their transactions in a **logfile**.

                            In the early 1990s, web site statistics consisted of counting the number
                            of client requests (**hits**) made to the web server.

                            <br>
                            This was a reasonable method initially, since each web site<br>often consisted of a
                            single HTML file. However, with the introduction of images in HTML, and web
                            sites that spanned multiple HTML files, this count became less useful.

                            <br>
                            <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i> [AWStats](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/) and [Webalizer](http://www.webalizer.org/)

                            Two units of measure were introduced in the mid-1990s to gauge more accurately
                            the amount of human activity on web servers:

                            * **page views**: a request made to the web server for a page,
                            * **visits** or **sessions**: a sequence of requests from a uniquely identified
                            client that expired after a certain amount of inactivity.

                            <br>
                            Because of caching, this method is not accurate enough.

                            In the mid-1990s, Web counters were commonly seen:

                            In the late 1990s this concept evolved to include a
                            **small invisible image** (called a [web
                            bug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bugs)) rather
                            than a visible one, and, by **using JavaScript**,
                            **to pass** along with the image request certain
                            **information about the page** and **the visitor**.

                            <br>
                            This information can then be processed remotely by
                            a web analytics company, and extensive statistics
                            generated.

                            Historically, vendors of page-tagging analytics solutions have used **third-party
                            cookies** sent from the vendor's domain instead of the domain of the website
                            being browsed.

                            Third-party cookies can handle visitors who cross multiple unrelated domains within
                            the company's site, since the cookie is always handled by the vendor's servers.
                            However, there are two problems: **privacy concerns** and **cookie deletion**.

                            <br>
                            Most vendors of page tagging solutions have now moved to provide at least the option
                            of using **first-party cookies** (i.e. cookies assigned from the client subdomain).

                            ## Overview

                            Google Analytics works by the **inclusion of a block of JavaScript code on pages**
                            in your website. When users to your website view a page, this JavaScript code
                            references a JavaScript file which then executes the **tracking operation**.

                            <br>
                            The tracking operation retrieves data about the page request through various
                            means and **sends this information** to the<br>Google Analytics server **via a list
                            of parameters attached to<br>a single-pixel image request**.

                            1. A browser requests a web page that contains the tracking code
                            2. A JavaScript `Array` named `_gaq` is created and tracking commands are pushed onto the array
                            3. A `<script>` element is created and enabled for asynchronous loading
                            4. The `ga.js` tracking code is fetched. Once fetched and loaded, the commands on the
                            `_gaq` array are executed and the array is transformed into a tracking object
                            5. Loads the script element to the DOM
                            6. After the tracking code collects data, the GIF request is sent to the Analytics database for
                            logging and post-processing

                            **Web tracking** or **Website visitor tracking** is the analysis of visitor
                            behaviour on a website. Analysis of an individual visitor's behaviour may be
                            used to provide that visitor with options or content that relates to their
                            implied preferences.

                            A cookie is _a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user's
                            web browser while the user is browsing that website_ according to
                            [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie).

                            <br>
                            Every time the user loads the website, **the browser sends the cookies back**
                            to the server to notify the website of the user's previous activity.

                            Cookies that are set during retrieval of these components are called

                            Let's say you have four websites:

                            * gizmodo.com
                            * slashdot.org
                            * wired.com
                            * facebook.com

                            You are a user, and you visit each of these websites.
                            Each of these websites also works with a third-party company whose
                            job is to serve ads, and named: `badboys.com`.

                            On every page of these websites, there is a web bug that points to
                            `badboys.com`'s adserver and requests an ad.

                            The most obvious way that a third-party tracker
                            (remember `badboys.com`?) might learn which account

                            A typical URL on a social networking site includes
                            a username or user ID number, and any third-party
                            will be able to see that.

                            1. Pick a **good cookie policy** for your browser, like **only keep
                            cookies until I close my browser**, or manual approval of all cookies
                            2. **Disable Flash cookies** and all the other kinds of **super cookies**
                            3. Use browser **extensions to control when third-party sites can include
                            content** in your pages or run code in your browser
                            3. Use [uBlock](https://www.ublock.org/) (ad blocker)
                            5. [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) ([Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/en/) is controversed)

                            **Browser fingerprinting** is a method of tracking
                            web<br>browsers by the configuration and settings
                            information<br>they make visible to websites.

                            <br>
                            If your browser is **unique**, then it's possible
                            that **an online tracker can identify you** even
                            without setting tracking cookies.

                            ## Google's PREF Cookie

                            Google assigns a **unique PREF cookie** anytime
                            someone's browser makes a connection to any of the
                            company's Web properties or services.

                            This can occur when consumers directly use Google
                            services (Search, Maps, etc.), or when they visit
                            websites that contain **embedded widgets** (Google Plus).

                            That cookie contains a code that allows Google to
                            uniquely<br>track users to **personalize ads**.

                            The **NSA** and its British counterpart, **GCHQ**, **are
                            using cookies** that advertising networks place on
                            computers **to identify people** browsing the Internet.

                            <br>
                            The intelligence agencies have found particular use
                            for a part of a Google-specific tracking mechanism
                            known as the **PREF cookie**.

                            These cookies typically don't contain personal
                            information, but they do contain numeric codes that
                            enable websites to uniquely identify a person's
                            browser.
